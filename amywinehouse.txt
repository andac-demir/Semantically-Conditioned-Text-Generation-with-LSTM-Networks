They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go

The man said, 'Why do you think you're here?'
I said, 'I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near.'
He said, "I just think you're depressed."
This me "Yeah, baby, and the rest."

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go

Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt,
Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt,
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray,

'Cause you're my fella, my guy,
Hand me your Stella and fly,
By the time I'm out the door,
You tear me down like Roger Moore,

I cheated myself,
Like I knew I would,
I told you I was trouble,
You know that I'm no good,

Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy,
He's in a place, but I can't get joy,
Thinking on you in the final throes,
This is when my buzzer goes,

Run out to meet you, chips and pitta,
You say, "When we're married,"
'Cause you're not bitter,
"There'll be none of him no more,"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor,

I cheated myself,
Like I knew I would,
I told you I was trouble,
You know that I'm no good,

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain,
We're like how we were again,
I'm in the tub, you on the seat,
Lick your lips as I soak my feet,
Then you notice little carpet burn,
My stomach drop and my guts churn,
You shrug and it's the worst,
Who truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself,
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble,
You know that I'm no good,

I cheated myself,
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble,
Yeah, you know that I'm no good.

When will we get the time to be just friends 
It's never safe for us not even in the evening 
'cos I've been drinking 
Not in the morning where your shit works 
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping 
And I've been thinking 
Can we be alone? 
Can we be alone? 

When will we get the time to be just friends 
When will we get the time to be just friends 

And no I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you 
If she don't first 
I'll never love you like her 
Though we need to find the time 
To just do this shit together 
For it gets worse 
I wanna touch you 
But that just hurts 

When will we get the time to be just just friends 
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends 
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends 
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends 
Just friends

Nobody stands in between me and my man, it's me
And Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that (ah)

No you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this

Rulers one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew (best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

Mr. Destiny 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's Me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black, black, black, black,
I go back to...
I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black


For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

All I can ever be to you
Is the darkness that we knew,
And this regret I've got accustomed to.
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night.

I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached.
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity.

[Chorus:]
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day
But I'm grown,
And in your way,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own.

I don't understand
Why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand.
We coulda never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal.
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon.

I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men.

[Chorus]

So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze,

[Chorus]

I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets

So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above,
A blaze that only lovers see,

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day
But I'm grown,
And in your way,
My blue shade
My tears dry on their own.

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day
But I'm grown,
And in your way,
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own.

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day
But I'm grown,
And in your way,
My deep shade
My tears dry

It's okay in the day I'm staying busy 
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he 
Got so sick of crying 
So just lately 
When I catch myself I do a 180 
I stay up clean the house 
At least I'm not drinking 
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking 
That silent sense of content 
That everyone gets 
Just disappears soon as the sun sets 

This face in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone 

If I was my heart 
I'd rather be restless 
The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless 
This ache in my chest 
As my day is done now 
The dark covers me and I cannot run now 
My blood running cold 
I stand before him 
It's all I can do to assure him 
When he comes to me 
I drip for him tonight 
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light 

His face in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done,
Reciting my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case

Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
And who you dying for
B - I would have died too
I'd have liked too
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting

He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant Her soul is taken
He thinks "What's she running from?"
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
Cause what's inside her, it never dies

So he tries to pacify her
Cause what's inside her never dies

Tell your boyfriend next time he around 
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down 
I wouldn't care if bre would give me some more 
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my draw 

When you smoke all my weed man 
You gotta call the green man 
So I can get mine and you get yours 

Once is enough to make me attack 
So bring me a bag and your man can come back 
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green 
I'm tighter than airport security teams 

When you smoke all my weed man 
You gotta call the green man 
So I can get mine and you get yours 

I'm my own man so when will you learn 
That you got a man but I got to burn 
Don't make no difference if I end up alone 
I'd rather have myself a smoke my homegrown 
It's got me addicted, does more than any dick did 

Yeh I can get mine and you get yours 
Yeh I can get mine and you get yours

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie [3x]

Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for ya
Are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie [3x]

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Cupid, 
Draw back your bow
I am begging your arrow flow
Straight to my lover´s heart 
For me, nobody but me

You better, please, 
Hear my cry 
And then your arrow fly 
Straight to my lover's heart 
For me. 

I don't want to bother you 
But I'm in distress 
As danger love is losing 
All my happiness
Oh, I love a man 
Who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid 
Draw back your bow 
And lay your arrow flow 
Straight to my lover´s heart
For me, nobody but me 

Cupid 
Please hear my cry 
I am begging your arrow fly 
Straight to my lover's heart 
For me. 

Now, if your arrow makes 
His love strong for me 
I swear I'm gonna love him 
Until eternity
I know between the both ofus
His heart we can steal 
You can help me if you will

So, cupid 
Draw back your bow 
And let your arrow flow 
Stragiht to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me 

Cupid, please hear my cry 
And then your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me 

Yeah yeah yeah cupid 
Oh oh cupid 
I love him love him

Only paid attention in your lessons
I Sat close at the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn?t speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head

I can't help but analyze your actions,
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on new years eve

I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn?t I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget

To know, know, know him 
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, 
Makes my life worthwhile

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I do, I do 

Oh, I'll be good to him, 
I'll bring joy to him
Oh, everyone says 
There'll come a day 
When I'll walk alongside of him
To know him is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, I do

Why can't he see, 
How blind can he be
Someday he'll see 
That he was meant for me

Oh oh, to know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, 
Oh, it makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I do.

For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
... know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
Laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game


You should be stronger than me
You've been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am,

You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair!
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy,

You should be stronger than me,
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Always wanna talk it through - I'm ok,
Always have to comfort you every day,
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be

And although my pride's not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah

And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me

And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me

Her name is Cherry
We've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely
Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying
And you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar

You're just a little boy underneath that hat 
You need your nerve to hide your ego - don't come with that 
You think everything is handed to you free 
But it's not that easy, no 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now and then 

My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you 
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm 
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you you'll whisk your head back the way it were 
As you were 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now and then 

[Ad lib]

Oh, I'm not ruling you out 
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 
I gotta show you now and them 
I gotta know you now and then 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again 

I gotta know you now 
We may never meet again

When you walk in the bar,
And you dressed like a star,
Rockin' your F me pumps.

And the men notice you,
With your Gucci bag crew,
Can't tell who he's lookin' to.

Cuz you all look the same,
Everyone knows your name,
And that's your whole claim to fame.

Never miss a night,
Cuz your dream in life,
Is to be a footballer's wife.

You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.

You don't like ballers,
They don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller.

You're more than a fan,
Lookin' for a man,
But you end up with one-nights-stands.

He could be your whole life,
If you got past one night,
But that part never goes right.

In the morning you're vexed,
He's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste.

Don't be too upset,
If they call you a skank,
Cuz like the news everyday you get pressed.

You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.

Or them big ballers,
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller,

You can't sit down right,
Cuz your jeans are too tight,
And you're lucky it's ladies night.

With your big empty purse,
Every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers.

So you did Miami,
Cuz you got there for free,
But somehow you missed the plane.

You did too much E,
Met somebody,
And spent the night getting caned.

Without girls like you,
There'd be no fun,
We'd go to the club and not see anyone.

Without girls like you,
There's no nightlife,
All those men just go home to their wives.

Don't be mad at me,
Cuz you're pushing thirty,
And your old tricks no longer work.

You should have known from the jump,
That you always get dumped,
So dust off your fuck me pumps

I couldn't resist him 
His eyes were like yours 
His hair was exactly the shade of brown 
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell 
It was dark and I was lying down 

You are everything - he means nothing to me 
I can't even remember his name 
Why're you so upset? 
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came 

What do you expect? 
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch 
Don't overreact - I pretended he was you 
You wouldn't want me to be lonely 

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand 
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you 
No he wasn't you 
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity 
It's not cheating; you were on my mind 

Yes he looked like you 
But I heard love is blind...

There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go 
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control 
Such a funny thing but everytime your near me 
I never can behave 
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic 
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so 
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave 
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to 
Anything, baby just let me get next to you 

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes? 
Bright as stars that shine up above you 
In the clear blue sky, how I worry bout you 
Just can't live my life without you 
Baby come here, don't have no fear 
Oh, is there wonder why 
I'm really feeling in the mood for love 

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear 
This little dream might fade away 
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you 
come and put our two hearts together 
That would make me strong and brave 
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 
If there's a cloud up above us 
Go on and let in rain 
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane 
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
and get a release from this awful misery 

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet 
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before 
Don't you understand me, now baby please 
Pull yourself together, do it very soon 
My heart's on fire, come on and take 
I'll be what you make me, my darling 

Oh baby, you make me feel so good 
Let me take you by the hand 
Come let us visit out there 
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find 
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind 
I'm so tired of being without it 
And never knew what love was all about 
Vince Henry you can come on hit me
you can blow now if you want to, I'm through

Wish I could say it breaks my heart 
like you did in the beginning 
Its not that we grew apart 
a nightingale no longer singing 

Its something i know you cant do 
seperate sex with emotion 
I sleep alone the sun comes up 
your still clinging to that notion 

Every thing is slowing down 
river of no return 
recognise my every sound 
there is nothing new to learn 

you'll never get my mind right 
like 2 ships passing in the night 
in the night, in the night 
want the same thing where we lay 
otherwise mines a different way 
a different way from where Im going 
oh, its you again listen this isnt a reunion 
so sorry if i turn my head 
yours is a familliar face 
but that dont make your place safe 
in my bed my bed my bed 

I never thought my memory 
of what we had could be intruded 
but I couldnt let it be 
I needed it as much as you did 

Now its not hard to understand 
why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand 
is to get the angle right 
Everything is slowing down 
river of no return 
you recognise my every sound 
theres nothing new to learn 

you'll never get my mind right 
like 2 ships passing in the night 
in the night in the night 
want the same thing where we lay 
otherwise mines a different way 
a different way from where im going 
oh, its you again listen this isnt a reunion 
so sorry if I turn my head 
yours is a familliar face 
but that dont make your place safe 
in my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed

Your neighbours were screaming 
I don't have a key for downstairs, so I punched all the buzzers hoping you wouldn't be there 
So now my head's hurting 
You say I always get my own way 
But you were in the shower when I got there, I'd have wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say 

Cos you were so beautiful before today 
But then I heard what you got to say...man that was ugly 

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Frank's in there and I don't care 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Just take it 
Take the box 

Take the box 

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be 
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me...you know me 
Feel so f*cking angry; don't wanna be reminded of you 
But when I left my sh*t in your kitchen, I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you 

Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense 
I just don't know you 
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? 
I think I love you 

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Frank's in there and I don't care 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Now take it 
Take the box 
Just take it, take it 
Take the box 
And now just take the box 
Take the box 

Take the box

Today my bird flew away
gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land everynight
I sang a lullaby every night
sang for my Ava every night.

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
she's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
birds surround her sweet sound
and Ava flies in paradise
and Ava flies in paradise

With dread I woke in my bed
to shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She spoke until one day she coudlnt be heard
she just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
she's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
birds surround her sweet sound
and Ava flies in paradise

Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
For behavioural patterns that stick over the years

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
(Help yourself, help yourself)
No, I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(Help yourself, no no no)
You can only get so much from someone else
(Get so much from, yeah)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself
(You can't help yourself)

You got a degree in philosophy (philosophy)
So, you think you're cleverer than me ('cause you're so smart)
But, I'm not just some drama queen (drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So, what do you expect from me (what do you want)
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
(I can't help you)
No, I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew

Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doing work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair.

Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Where's my moral parallel?

It takes me half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track


His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize

Brother
It's so much that I could never say to your face
But by now
You should know the world and all its ways
So find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend
A son, not a sob story

(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
And your priority it must be heard
(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
Cause we'll never be the way we were

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now, well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like it's so run-through

(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
Cause we'll never be the way we were

The way we were
We'll never be
At your priority, it must be her

Every day I see you,
My hands were made for you,
And you always give me stress me free point of view,
Pick you up after school

(Mr. Magic) Take a token,
(Mr. Magic) Of my love,
(Mr. Magic) I see you through the smoke

Without you, a misery,
Blue with a migraine,
All the songs sound better when you're next to me,
Hey, cause they come naturally

Laying on my bed,
I reach over for you,
And you so fresh you even make the standards bloom,
But it's just to get you through

(Mr. Magic)
(Mr. Magic)
(Mr. Magic)
Waiting for the smoke to clear.
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear

I would die before I divorce ya
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove

Does anyone who will listen up
To our victories and dumb defeats
Knows they all take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I go with him, my hand flicks
I'm sitting on the royal flush

Women drink him in, swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and cash the chips you've got
And here maybe two, oh two bottles of
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heart beat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

All I can ever be to you,
Is the darkness we once knew,
And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right
Anticipation at its height,
Lived in and waiting in hotel room late at night

I knew I hadn't met my match,
With every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I let myself get so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to cut myself off I had no capacity

[Chorus:]
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in your grey, in this cool shade,
My tears dry on their own,

I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things than him at hand,
We could have never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
And this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon,

I cannot play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men,


Wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debt
And as we kiss goodbye
The sun behind you sets
So we are history
Your shadow covers me,
The sky above,
A blaze that only lovers see

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in your grey
In this cool shade,
My tears dry on their own,

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
Baby, in your grey
In this cool shade,
My tears dry on their own,

Yeah, leave your grey to shade
My tears dry on their own

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Yeah

I never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke I hung around
And be your balance

[Verse Rap 1: Nas]
It's not a movie
This is not script to proof read
I spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Tryna punctuate pronounciate the funds I make amounts I take
Put in your face oh, my mistake you're not a floozy?
Then excuse me before I talk my style
Introduce me get your name and phone number like one two three
Y'all know the story y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative this is legendary
The good Samaritan good thespian like a polygamist
With a twist will I marry again? maybe I guess
I hold a lady interest I just met the love scholar
She the teacher's pet
Every other eve we'd meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumph with no strings just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Hunting for the answers why did God take away the homie
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? ?uz I'm deemed a heartbreaker
Like smoke girls linger round a player yeah-yuh

Yo, This recession is a test, It's affecting my complexion,
Miss-directing my affection
My concerns of bill collections
The facts is the taxes they're after me chapter 3,
My property my handlers they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the World Bank trust like I'm IEG,
This fly sweet bourgeoisie,
Tall freak she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She's says no you so deep
I said no let's go thru it
Historically so
Ruthless feds came for Joe Lewis
She said my man u needs to laugh sometime
Classifies me as a bore I told her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy at her dismay
She's thinking that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it's a drag
And it's a bust and you're in tune with just lust
I'm thru with you after I crush
So is that humorous enough
The smoke I puff
Tell a car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whiskey Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet some Monie Loves so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there,
Everybody in the club tonight say yeah,
You know how me and Amy are straight players

Well sometimes I go out, by myself, and I look across the water.
And I think of all the things, of what you're doing, and in my head I paint a picture.
Since I've come home, well my body's been a mess, and I miss your ginger hair, and the way you like to dress.
Oh wont you come on over, stop making a fool out of me, why dont you come on over, Valerie.

Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer.
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you find the right man, who'll fix it for you.
Are you shopping anywhere, change the colour of your hair, are you busy.
And did you have to pay that fine, that you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy.
Well since I come home, well my body's been a mess, and I miss your tender hair, and the way you like to dress.
Oh wont you come on over, stop making a fool out of me, oh why don't you come on over, Valerie.

Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Well sometimes I go out, by myself, and I look across the water.
And I think of all the things, of what you're doing, and in my head I paint a picture.
Since I've come home, well my body's been a mess, and I miss your ginger hair, and the way you like to dress.
Oh wont you come on over, stop making a fool out of me, oh why dont you come on over, Valerie.

Valerie

Why don't you come on over Valerie...

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa
When she walks, it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa

Oh, how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But instead, when she walks to the sea,
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I go
The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema...

Oh. how I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But instead, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile,
But she doesn't see.
She ain't looking at me.

Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can’t help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won’t get the chance

Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And I swallow it whole
You should thank your lucky star
Cause the music is a gift
And it’s stronger than all else
Provides me with the bliss

Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It’s too much to take, yeah
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180

I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears when the sun sets

[Chorus:]
He gets fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked to his soul he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now

My blood running cold, I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light

[Chorus]

And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone

I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends, right?

You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
You don't want me in the flat when you're home at night
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between
Nicki's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
You want me to suffer just cause you were born white
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
It's easy to smoke it up and forget
Everything that happened in between

I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I want to smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla and you get the draw

Because we are best friends, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends, right?
Because we are best friends, right?

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darlin', won't you please see through me?
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front, well baby I was hiding
But now I'm so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Cause you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember [x5]
When we were together
And I was singing this song for you

We were alone and
I was singing this song for you

Swinging back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning

My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new
Physically you ain't my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind

I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too

I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again
Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even saidMake a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that I'm sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release

Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, I'm wasting my breath
Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath

Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I can't touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I don't care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause I'm the shit I earn I can't look for my sins
Oh, oh, no

I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends...right?

You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right?

She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned

Now she won't be happy
Till she looks down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
Cause she will be waiting years for her wedding

For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail and wasting her time
She calls herself his wife

He calls her at 8 and says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring it's not a good fit
So next time that they row she throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

So take the gold you find
And for your own sake hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse
For me it ain't real, yes it's fools gold
Fools gold, fools gold

I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco when everyone was in jeans

But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a taste unknown

But you were a rich girl, only having fun
Your worn-out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote you in this song
Hey, little rich girl, baby, love is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong

At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
Caused him so much heartache because the screen star was you
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on a dream

But You were just a rich girl, only having fun
Your worn-out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

Running down my batt-er-ies
Laying me out to rest
Knowing when that in
Five hours
I'll wake up and de-stress
And I'm digging myself into a hole
And these days I just work
When once I had so much soul

[Chorus:]
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now - my mind - is working overtime
It's been a looong day
Such a long day, ay, ay

Mmm and while all my contemporaries
(All my friends, yeah)
Are sitting in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
My guitar through London town
And the thing that wakes me when
I could sleep instead
Is the thought that tonight
I can fall back into bed

[Chorus:]
And lately, I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a looooooong day
It's been a long day (a long day)

Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much

[Chorus:]
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooong

I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now

My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through

Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow

And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work

Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work

[Chorus (Amy):]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

[Verse 1 (Amy):]
I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
'cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Chorus (Amy):]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
[Jay-Z:]
(Now rocking with the best Amy baby)

[Verse 2 (Amy):]
The man said 'why do you think you here?'
I said 'I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
so I always keep a bottle near'
He said 'I just think your depressed',
[Jay-Z:]
(The best Amy Amy)
kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest

[Chorus (Amy & Jay-Z):]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' (Yes)
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know

[Verse 3 (Jay-Z):]
Young, uh
More money, more checks, I'm addicted to fresh
6 pair of kicks is my definition of 12 steps
Kick back in the back, get the phantom to drop
Bass blaring outta my system, that's how I detox
O when will he stop, he still pumping that real shit
My flow so dumb, my face is numb, nigga, I don't feel shit
Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me
Oh look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping
Everytime I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehabed him,'stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion?
My heroine flows more deeper than Marilyn's nose I'm an O.D.
'til I'm in peace like Anna Nicole,
Hov!

[Verse 4 (Amy):]
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
have everyone think I'm on the mend
It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

It begins to tell,'round midnight, 'round midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown and suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad, 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
So when my heart is still with you
Yes ol' midnight knows it, too

For 'round midnight, when it comes around
So let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around, cause I'm feelin' sad,
And it really gets bad 'round midnight, 'round midnight

I can see you ahead of me,
But I'm not always forward thinking,
I'll tell you what you want to hear,
It depends on what I've been drinking.

'Cause everything I do or say,
Makes it hard for you to stay,
We both know, What it is.

Nowadays we talk too much,
Like you're forgetting all the good shit,
You decide whats wrong with me,
I always used to let you say,
But now I like to think out loud,
You're running with some different crowd,
We both know, What it is.

I don't know you anymore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by,
And you're attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, cry.

Mr Ultra Sensitive,
I'll never let myself forget you,
Messed each other up you know,
So I'm sorry if I upset you,
Tomorrow is another day so I'll call you cause that's OK,
We both know, What it is.

I don't know you anymore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life.
And your attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, I cant even cry.

Relationship doesn't remain,
We resonate on different planes,
I could cut you down again,
If you was like all other men,
If you were like all other men,
I know that I could shut you down again,
But my friend, but my friend.

I don't know you anymore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life.
Your attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry.

I don't know you anymore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by.
Your attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry.

Waitress on skates, in trainin'
They dart to call it dreaming
Images present themselves to me
Seeds are ripe for reaping 
I continue sleepin'
You're everything you ever wanted to be
And nothin' here is changing
No messy rearranging 
Cause every set of ficus stays the same
Sinatra's always singing
And you do all the clinging
And someone else accepts my place
Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close

Turn and face my ceiling 
Deep in all the feeling
Inhibitions turn to dust and fly away
Stop my eyelids flickering 
With your petty bickering
But this time I say what I got to say

I hear my girl Dinah's playing 
And tree branches start swayin'
Run over and sit right by the roof
And I see the leaves are growing 
Little buds are showing
Reach out a hand
And bite into the fruit

Whatever my imagination throws 
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close

Nothin' such a scrutiny 
Voiding purple mutual
You are loving beautifully
And it's fragrant beautifully
Colorful and monochrome
Amy Winehouse alone
Far away from ringing phone at home
I turn to stone, turn to stone
And all the thoughts are static
Yeah, my singing is automatic
And I wish that I could sell it
In my every urge you tell her
Cause I can sense no danger
I am the lone ranger
Through the desert in a yellow caddy
With a black haired blue eyed stranger! 

White dress outside drying
I've been fear for flying
I overtake Montgomery in skills, yeah
Never been more daring
Kitten heels I'm wearing 
Reality a blow that sometimes kills

When I drop it lyrically
Words evolve generically
And I don't ever need to collapse in tears
And I could curse your timing 
Thunderously miming
And I feel young beyond my years

Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close...

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wonderin' how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end

First time I swallow, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

There is no greater love 
Than what I feel for you 
No sweeter song, no heart so true 

There is no greater thrill 
Than what you bring to me 
No sweeter song 
Than what you sing, sing to me 

You're the sweetest thing 
I have ever known 
And to think that you are mine alone 

There is no greater love 
In all the world, it's true 
No greater love 
Than what I feel for you

Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends
So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town
